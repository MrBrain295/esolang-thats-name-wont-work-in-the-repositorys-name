As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time
Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart

If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

When you're hurting, feeling ashamed
When you're numbing off your pain
When you've lost your way

And you can be whole again
Even a million scars doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
Beautifully broken
Every fear of being loved
For who you are no matter what
When you're stumbling,
And you're haunted by regret
And the darkness closes in
Just listen
You're beautifully broken
And You can be whole again
Even a million scars doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
Beautifully broken
You're beautifully broken
You're beautifully broken
Oh, the God who made the stars
Is the God that made your heart
And He's holding you right now
He can heal the broken parts
And make beauty from the scars, the scars
Beautiful scars!
You're beautifully broken
And You can be whole again
Even a million scars doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
You're beautifully broken
And You can be whole again
Even a million scars doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
You're beautifully broken
Beautifully broken
You're beautifully broken""")
